# 🔭 Astronomical Image Processor with AI

This is a simple web app that allows you to upload an **astronomical image** (or any photo), processes it using various **image enhancement techniques**, and then explains the results using **Google Gemini AI**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

You upload a photo, and the app:
1. Applies 9 different image processing techniques (like contrast adjustment, smoothing, sharpening, etc.).
2. Sends each processed image to **Gemini AI**, which gives a short 3-line description explaining what the image shows.
3. Displays all versions of the image with their AI-generated explanations.

It's like giving your telescope images a smart assistant!

- ✅ Applies the following techniques:
  - Original view
  - Contrast stretching
  - Negative effect
  - Log transformation
  - Gamma correction
  - Histogram equalization
  - Smoothing (blur)
  - Sharpening (edge enhancement)
  - Thresholding (binary image)
- ✅ Uses **Gemini AI** to analyze and describe each image in human-readable text
- ✅ Fast and interactive — all processed right on your machine

## 🖼️ Example Output

Each image you upload results in this kind of output:

- **Contrast Stretching**  
  _"Brighter central regions indicate higher intensity. Color spread is widened. Possible heat sources are better highlighted."_

- **Negative Image**  
  _"Dark regions turn light and vice versa. Helps detect low-intensity details. Inverts color relationships for visibility."_

And so on, for each version of the image.
